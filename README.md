# Natural Language Processing(NLP) and synonyms 

<p align="justify">
Finding a synonym for a specific word is easy for a human to do using a thesaurus. A thesaurus or synonym dictionary is a general reference for finding synonyms and sometimes the antonyms of a word. A computer application can be programmed to lookup synonyms using a variery of methods.  There are several issues with some of the methods, including selecting the wrong synonym based on context.  For example, one of the synonyms for "mother" is "mum."  The word "mum" can have mutiple meanings. As an adjective the word means to be quiet or slient. As a noun the word "mum" refer to someone's mother in British English or flowering perennial plants of the genus Chrysanthemum.  Computers also have issues when a corpus has related synonyms within the same text being analyzed.

For instance. considering this text:

<i>"My mom always likes to receive mums on Mother's day."</i>

A human reading this text would instantly know that "mom" and "mother" are related and "mums" is referring to flowers.  A computer would have some difficulty in determining the similarities or non-similarities between words in this sentence.
